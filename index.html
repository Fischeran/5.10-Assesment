    <!-- adding a div element here so I can structure the paragraphs into a more condenced format so they don't just run accross the whole screeen -->
    
    <p>After graduating college at San Francisco State University I've speant the last few years of my life working various desk jobs, currently I work at a payroll company and help troubleshoot issues for cutomers when navigating our software. Being in San Francisco for 8 years i made a lot of friends who worked in tech and I have always wanted to make the career switch to software developement, as I have always had a passion for technology and different kinds of softwares such as Ableton, Discord, and all of the Adobe products just to name a few.</p>
    <p>Outside of work I can be found generally in one of threee places at a coffee shop, in a park, or infront of my computer. I love going around on the weekends and looking for cool places to eat and new places to explore. I spend a lot of time on the computer doing god knows what, generally either playing video games or diving deep into a never ending youtube black hole. I am a huge nerd for science fixtion, horror, and anime, but I caution people before talking with me about it because I will go way too deep into things. But for the time being I have decided to put all that on hold to make a career change into software developement</p>
    <p>This year I decided to take a leap of faith and have started a software engineering course at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> and I could not be more excited. I look foward to learning about api's, web design, and the ins and outs of how web pages and softwares operate. I cannot wait to start my career in developement and look foward to joining a collaboritive team where I can work with people and grow my skills at the same time.</p>
